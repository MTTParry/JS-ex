// Week 2 - Loops

// In the following exercises, you will need to place your code or answer underneath each
// exercise prompt.

// First try answering these without using references or looking up any information.
// Then, check your answer by using references and/or running your code.
// You can run your JS code using the Chrome or Firefox Developer tools, or by using Node.js.
// Feel free to update your answers if you got them wrong at first -- this exercise is for your own learning.
// But make sure you understand why the correct answer is right.

// Exercise 1. Write a 'while' loop that prints the integers (whole numbers)
// between 1 and 5 (inclusive).

console.log("Exercise 1"); //I'm adding these so in the console screen I can tell what answers belong to which problems

function exercise1(num1) {
  let i=1;
  while (i <= num1) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
  }
}

exercise1(5); //prints 1-5

// Exercise 2. Write a 'do while' loop that prints the integers (whole numbers)
// between 1 and 5 (inclusive).
console.log("Exercise 2");

function exercise2(num2) {
  let i = 1;
  do {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
  } while (i <= num2);
}

exercise2(5); //prints 1-5

// Exercise 3. Write a 'for' loop that prints the integers (whole numbers)
// between 1 and 5 (inclusive).
console.log("Exercise 3");

function exercise3(num3) {
  for (i=1; i <= num3; i++) {
    console.log(i);
  }
}

exercise3(5);

// Exercise 4. Now we want a loop that prints the integers
// counting DOWN from 10 to 1 (inclusive). Write three loops that do this, to practice
// writing loops in all 3 ways -- as a 'while', 'do while', and 'for' loop.
console.log("Exercise 4");

console.log("while loop");
function exercise4a(num4a) { 
  let i=num4a;
  while (i > 0) { 
    console.log(i);
    i--;
  }
}
exercise4a(5); //prints 5-1

console.log("do while loop");
function exercise4b(num4b) {
  let i = num4b;
  do {
    console.log(i);
    i--;
  } while (i > 0); 
}
exercise4b(5); //prints 5-1


console.log("for loop");
function exercise4c(num4c) { 
  for (i = num4c; i > 0; i--) { //for loop
    console.log(i);
  }
}
exercise4c(5); //prints 5-1

// Exercise 5. Write a loop that prints the integers from 7 to 27. Write this
// loop in all 3 ways -- as a 'while', 'do while', and 'for' loop.
console.log("Exercise 5");
console.log("while loop");
function exercise5a() { 
  let i=7;
  while (i <= 27) { 
    console.log(i);
    i++;
  }
}
exercise5a(); //prints 7-27

console.log("do while loop");
function exercise5b() {
  let i = 7;
  do {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
  } while (i <= 27); 
}
exercise5b(); //prints 7-27


console.log("for loop");
function exercise5c() { 
  for (i = 7; i <= 27; i++) { //for loop
    console.log(i);
  }
}
exercise5c(); //prints 7-27


// Exercise 6. Write a loop that prints numbers between 0 and 100, counting by tens.
// I.e. it will print 10, then 20, then 30, etc.
// Write this loop in all 3 ways -- as a 'while', 'do while', and 'for' loop.
console.log("Exercise 6");
console.log("While loop");
function exercise6a() {
  let i=0;
  while (i <= 100) {
    i+=10;
    console.log(i);
  }
}
exercise6a();

console.log("Do while loop");
function exercise6b() {
  let i=0;
  do {
    i+=10;
    console.log(i);
  } while (i < 100);
}
exercise6b();

console.log("For loop");
function exercise6c() {
  for (i = 0; i < 100; i += 10) {
    console.log(i);
  }
}
exercise6c();

// Exercise 7. Add a comment as to why the following loop is an infinite loop (will
// run without ever stopping). Then fix the loop so that it stops when
// counterFour is equal to -100.

/*
let counterFour = 1;
while (counterFour < 2) {
  console.log("HELP ME!");
  counterFour--;
}
*/

console.log("Exercise 7 - Comment in code");
//this will print forever because "counterFour" is forever decreasing, so it will always be smaller than 2.



// Exercise 8. Make a variable that contains your favorite integer. Write a loop
// (your choice which type) that prints the integers from 0 to that number.
console.log("Exercise 8");
function exercise8(num8) {
  let i=0;
  while (i <= num8) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
  }
}
exercise8(164); //counts from 0-164

// Exercise 9. Make a variable that contains your favorite integer (this time make sure it's
// less than 100). Write a loop (your choice which type) that prints the integers from 0 to 100.
// Next to each number it should print "not my favorite number". But next to your favorite
// number it should print "my favorite number!". Example output (if your favorite number was 2):
// 0 not my favorite number
// 1 not my favorite number
// 2 my favorite number!
// 3 not my favorite number
// ...
// (Hint - use an if statement in your loop)
console.log("Exercise 9");
function exercise9(num9) {
  for (i=0; i<=100; i++) {
    if (i===num9) {
      console.log(i +" my favorite number!");
    } else {
      console.log(i + " not my favorite number");
    }
  }
}
exercise9(4); //works


// Exercise 10. In some of the exercises above, we had you write all 3 types of loops, for practice.
// But in real life, how would you decide which type of loop to use? You might not have an
// exact answer, but spend a few minutes thinking about the different types of loops and/or
// doing some research and write down your thoughts in a comment below:
console.log("Exercise 10 - comment in code");
//I did a little bit of research and it looks like these different kinds of loops are used a little bit differently, but are pretty similar.
//A 'do while' loop will keep executing a loop until a specified condition is true.
//A 'for loop' will keep executing a set number of times.
//A 'while loop' will keep executing while a condition is true, stopping when it is no longer true.

// Exercise 11. Now we'll practice using nested loops (a loop inside another loop)!
// Update the nested loops below to so that for each value of outsideCounter,
// the inside loop will show a countdown

/*
counting down from 0
*********************************** 
counting down from 1
inside 1
*********************************** 
counting down from 2
inside 2
inside 1
*********************************** 
counting down from 3
inside 3
inside 2
inside 1
*********************************** 
*/
console.log("Exercise 11");

function countingDown() {
  for (let outsideCounter = 0; outsideCounter <= 3; outsideCounter++) {
    console.log("counting down from", outsideCounter);
    for (let insideCounter = outsideCounter; insideCounter >=1; insideCounter--) {
      console.log("inside", insideCounter);
    }
    console.log("***********************************");
  }
}
countingDown();



// Congrats, you made it to the end!
// Did you find this easy or hard? If you used references, which ones helped you?
// Please answer in a comment below.
// This was more challenging than last week's stuff, and some of the problems took me a little while (but my problems were usually syntax errors).
// I used w3schools, freecodecamp, and some of my old replit files for references. I also asked Brie K. for help with one of the conceptual problems.
