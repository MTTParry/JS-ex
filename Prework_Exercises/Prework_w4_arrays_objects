// Week 3 - Arrays and Objects

// In the following exercises, you will need to place your code or answer underneath each
// exercise prompt.

// First try answering these without using references or looking up any information.
// Then, check your answer by using references and/or running your code.
// You can run your JS code using the Chrome or Firefox Developer tools, or by using Node.js.
// Feel free to update your answers if you got them wrong at first -- this exercise is for your own learning.
// But make sure you understand why the correct answer is right.

// Exercise 1. Make an empty array named animals

const animals = [];

// Exercise 2. Add the string "frog" to the array

animals.push("frog");

// Exercise 3. Add 4 more animals of your choice to the array. Try to add all of them in one line of code.

animals.push("cat", "dog", "shark", "horse");

// Exercise 4. Update the first item in the array to be "gorilla"

animals[0] = "gorilla";

// Exercise 5. Print the number of items in the array (use the array property that will give you this information)

console.log(animals.length);

// Exercise 6. Print the first item in the array

console.log(animals[0]);

// Exercise 7. Print the last item in the array (as part of your answer, use the same array property you used in exercise 5 above)

console.log(animals[animals.length - 1]);

// Exercise 8. Remove the last item from the array

animals.pop();

// Exercise 9. Now make a new array named assortedThings that contains at least 3 strings and 3 numbers.

const assortedThings = ["dog", "face", "noun", 2, 4, 6];

// Exercise 10. Write a for loop that iterates through the assortedThings array and prints each index and item, such as:
// Item #0 is potato
// Item #1 is 4
// Item #2 is Hello World
// ...

function iteratesThroughArray(array) {
    for (i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        console.log("Item number " + i + " is " + array[i]);
    }
}

iteratesThroughArray(assortedThings);

// Exercise 11. Write a function that takes an array of numbers as a parameter. For each number in the array,
// print the number and "BIG" if it's over 100, "small" if it's between 0 and 100, and "negative" if
// it's less than 0. Example:
// if the array is [-2, 200, 50], print:
// -2 negative
// 200 BIG
// 50 small
//
// Then write some function calls you would use to test your function.

function numberSize(numArray) {
    for (i = 0; i < numArray.length; i++) {
        if (numArray[i] > 100) {
            console.log(numArray[i] + " BIG");
        } else if (numArray[i] <= 100 && numArray[i] >= 0) {
            console.log(numArray[i] + " small");
        } else if (numArray[i] < 0) {
            console.log(numArray[i] + " negative");
        }
    }
}

const numList = [-2, 200, 50, 0, 3000, -20, 100]
numberSize(numList);

// Exercise 12. Make an object called me that contains the following keys: name, favoriteAnimal, favoriteNumber
// The values of those keys can be whatever you choose.

const me = {
    name: "Michaela",
    favoriteAnimal: "cat",
    favoriteNumber: "64"
}

// Exercise 13. Add another 2 keys and values to the object (you choose what they are)

me.favoriteColor = "green";
me.yearOfBirth = 1990;

// Exercise 14. Update the favoriteAnimal value to something different

me.favoriteAnimal = "cheetah";

// Exercise 15. Print the value of favoriteAnimal.

console.log(me.favoriteAnimal);
console.log(me['favoriteAnimal']);

// Note: there are at least 2 ways to get the value of a key, try to write both.

// Congrats, you made it to the end!
// Did you find this easy or hard? If you used references, which ones helped you?
// Please answer in a comment below.
// I think I'm weakest with arrays right now, so I definitely looked things up, but for most of that, as soon as I looked at the results I recognized and remembered how to do the things.
// I mostly used MDN, but I also looked at my own coding notes (just terms that I have written down and defined).
